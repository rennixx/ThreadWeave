    "user_prompt_template": "Convert the following Twitter thread into a {target_duration}-second animated video script optimized for vertical video (9:16 aspect ratio).\n\nTHREAD CONTENT:\n{thread_text}\n\nART STYLE: {art_style}\n\nCreate a JSON response with this exact structure:\n{{\n  \"metadata\": {{\n    \"art_style\": \"{art_style}\",\n    \"total_duration\": {target_duration},\n    \"scene_count\": <number>\n  }},\n  \"scenes\": [\n    {{\n      \"scene_number\": 1,\n      \"duration\": 3.5,\n      \"visual_description\": \"detailed visual description optimized for vertical mobile viewing\",\n      \"narration_text\": \"clear, concise narration that captures the key point\",\n      \"camera_movement\": \"static | zoom_in | zoom_out | pan_left | pan_right\"\n    }}\n  ]\n}}\n\nTHREAD-VIDEO RULES:\n1. Create 6-10 scenes total for optimal pacing\n2. Each scene should be 2-5 seconds (shorter is better for engagement)\n3. Total duration should equal {target_duration} seconds (±3 seconds acceptable)\n4. Visual descriptions MUST be optimized for vertical 9:16 mobile format:\n   - Focus on single, clear visual concepts per scene\n   - Use minimal, clean compositions that work at small sizes\n   - Consider mobile viewing: bold shapes, clear subjects, good contrast\n   - For threads: visualize the progression of ideas, not literal text rendering\n5. For different art styles, tailor descriptions:\n   - Watercolor: flowing, organic forms, soft gradients, layered washes\n   - Pixel art: blocky elements, limited color palette, retro gaming aesthetic\n   - Minimalist: simple shapes, negative space, clean lines, flat colors\n   - 3D render: volumetric lighting, depth of field, smooth surfaces\n   - Anime: expressive characters, dynamic poses, cel-shaded look\n6. Narration rules:\n   - Capture the MAIN point of each tweet/tweet segment\n   - Use conversational, engaging language\n   - Keep sentences under 15 words for better pacing\n   - Avoid repeating the same wording as the original thread\n7. Camera movement guidelines:\n   - Use 'static' for text-heavy or complex scenes\n   - Use 'zoom_in' to emphasize key points or reveals\n   - Use 'zoom_out' for establishing context or conclusions\n   - Use sparingly - too much motion can be distracting on mobile\n8. Scene progression:\n   - Each scene should advance the narrative\n   - Create visual flow between related concepts\n   - Use consistent visual elements across scenes for cohesion\n\nRespond with ONLY the JSON, no additional text or markdown.",
